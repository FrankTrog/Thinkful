          it seems that either ondblclick or click works in this case; 
          ALSO, when I press enter after entering a guess in the text box, the program starts over and does not submit the answer - why is that? 
          do i need to use an event name for pressing enter so that pressing enter DOES submit the guess?
          -->

          ondblclick only triggers on a dblclick so it isn't preferred. 
          Click isn't either as you really should trigger it on enter
          I suggest using functions and event listeners within the .js file rather than setting onclick or ondblclick attributes.
          
          Answer #2
          When you use a form pressing enter in an input is built into the browser as submitting the form which was built to send information to another page.
          Essentially the browser reloads the page.
          We have to stop this behavior using event.preventDefault(); within the function called when enter is pressed in the input. 
          $('input').keypress(function(e){
          	event.preventDefault();
          });
          -->

          for some reason using a Submit button to submit guesses did not work the way I wanted it to; 
          the answer feedback appeared for a second in gamereply div then disappeared 
		  <button>Submit</button>
          -->

          Same as #2 above. Pressing a button with the type of submit lets the form know to submit and send information to another page or the current page.
          Essentially the browser reloads the page.
          It is better with buttons to set their type to button rather than submit.

		  <p>Please enter a number between 1 and 50 inclusive.</p>
		  
		  <!--this div is where feedback about the user's answer appears; it also, for now, shows the answer because I was testing the code to make sure the random number stayed the same when it needed to; in initial code, a new random number would be generated when it actually needed to stay the same for the current guess attempts-->
