        The default functionality of the submit button in a form is to submit the form to the specified
        page and if no parameters are set it reloads the page which is why it looked like it was working
        but disappeared. Look into e.preventDefault();
        -->

	<p>Double click in the text box after you've typed your entry to submit it.</p>
	<ol id="livelist">
	<!--these are the 2 items that are supposed to be hard-coded-->
	  <li><input type="checkbox" /><label contenteditable="true">milk</label></li>
	  <!--I tried to use the contenteditable attribute above to enable users to 
	  edit entries they've submitted. It lets me add text BEFORE "milk" but won't let me delete the word "milk." Why is that? And is there a better way to enable text editing? -->
      <!-- COMMENT - FRANK
      This has to do with direct vs delegated events.
      Direct events are targeting specific elements that exist when the code is initially run and event listeners are set.
      $('div').click(function(){ /* Do something */ } );
      Delegated events are targeting parent elements which will always exist and when the event happens on the parent it checks to see if the event actually happened on the child 
      within the parent and if so runs the function.
      $('div').on('click','p',function(){/*do something */});
